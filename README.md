BassieImage a simple and fast image viewer for Windows because the Windows UWP Photos app is fucking slow and the .NET Windows Photo Library app don't has a dark mode

## Todo list:
- 32-bit & no SSE2 SIMD so Windows 2000+ support
- Animated gifs
- Back button
- Next / Previous buttons indexing and working
- Zoom & scrollbars
